## Wins & Loses:
### No Looping
I worked really hard at the on-set of writing my code to make sure I started with pseudocode that was detailed enough that I could figure out all my .js without having a single loop. 

I am proud of my battle function:

 ### Widdling Down
 I am very proud of my code. I feel like I learned more than I thought possible but I need to focus on making my code even more concise. This project took my 80+ hours to complete, and I look forward to widdling that time down.
